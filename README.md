A yet (and probably ever) unfinished port of eco-ocean to elm.

## Current State

[Here's a gif](docs/eco.gif) of a "ship" fishing the seas. Also you can see the fish-population recovering slowly after fishing.

## Hacking

```
npm install -g yarn
yarn
yarn start
# point your browser to http://localhost:3002!
```
